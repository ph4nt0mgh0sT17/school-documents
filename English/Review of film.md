<h1>The Dark Knight</h1>

The Dark Knight is one of the best action films I have ever seen. This film was released in 2008, directed by Christopher Nolan,
it stars Christian Bale as night protector Batman and multi-millionaire Bruce Wayne, and Heath Leadger as The Joker, the villain in this film.

It's the story about genius villain, mastermind of the crime, the Joker. All he wants is to destroy everything. He wants chaos.
And Batman has to stop him before it's late. Will Batman stop Joker, or it is too late?

The film is set in the Gotham City, which is known from Batman comics. The soundtrack which is performed by famous Hans Zimmer
was really exciting and impressive. The acting was the best thing about the film. Heath Ledger perfectly performed his character. 
His character was performed exactly as it is in the comics. And developing of Batman's character seemed realistic. Pure crazy lunatic. And special effect were used rarely, but they looked smoothly.

I highly recommend The Dark Knight, especially if you are fan of comics or Batman at least. I am sure you will enjoy every single moment.
